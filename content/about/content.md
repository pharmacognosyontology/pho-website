The Pharmacognosy Ontology (PHO) is an open [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) and its associated tools and databases describing Natural Products and pharmacognosy work.

It is currently in development, and we are soon going to publish a preliminary public version of it.
